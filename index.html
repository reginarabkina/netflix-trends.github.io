        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix once dominated the global streaming industry, but now numerous platforms compete for viewers'
            attention. Streaming has become the new norm in a way, as it begins to replace cable television, with
            channels moving content to their own platforms. New competitors such as Max, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video,
            Hulu, and many more have entered the streaming arena. While Netflix still holds power in its respective
            industry, how has the application changed across the years? With new competition, it becomes clear that the
            platform must continue expanding its library as it has done in the past, but does this mean sacrificing
            quality in exchange for quantity? Additionally, does it cater to the same audience it always has, or has
            that shifted as time has progressed? Our project aims to analyze these questions, as well as many more,
            regarding Netflix and how it has adapted with time.

            To learn more, you can visit the article <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/72/4/511/6605780">
                Netflix, Library Analysis, and Globalization: Rethinking Mass Media Flows</a>, which examines Netflix's
            2021 data, revealing strategies like offering binge-worthy shows and releasing content in multiple languages
            to appeal to a global audience.
            Another article,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15274764221100474">“We Don’t Aspire to Be
                Netflix”</a>, explores Netflix’s growth over time, highlighting its expansion to more countries, growing
            viewer bases, and use of user data for tailored recommendations.
            Both papers offer valuable insights into Netflix's evolving strategies, providing context for our analysis
            of Netflix trends and the changes observed in the data.

        <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
        <p>
            For our analysis, we utilize two datasets from Kaggle: <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/netflix-imdb-scores/data">Netflix IMDB Scores</a>
            and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows"> Netflix Movies and TV
                Shows</a>.
            The merged dataset contains 10 columns and entries, spanning from 2008 to 2021. It provides a comprehensive
            overview of
            Netflix's content offerings during this period.

            Understanding Netflix’s content library is just the first step—how have audience ratings changed over time?
            By analyzing IMDb score trends, we can see how Netflix’s evolving content strategy has influenced viewer
            reception. The visualization below highlights these shifts, showing how IMDb scores have varied across
            different media runtimes.

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    The analysis of IMDb ratings across different media lengths reveals several key takeaways. First,
                    the average audience rating remains fairly consistent across short, medium, and long films. The
                    median scores are all quite close, suggesting that simply making a film longer or shorter doesn’t
                    guarantee a better rating. Additionally, the range of ratings, from lower to upper quartiles, is
                    quite similar across all three categories, meaning no particular length consistently leads to more
                    unpredictable or varied reviews. However, there are some distinctions in the presence of outliers.
                    Shorter films tend to have the most extreme ratings, with both very high and very low scores
                    appearing more often. Medium-length films also exhibit some outliers, but longer films tend to
                    remain within a more stable rating range, indicating that short films may be more of a “hit or miss”
                    with audiences. Interestingly, the highest-rated media are more frequently found in the short
                    category, with a top rating of 9.3, slightly above the best-rated medium (9.2) and long (8.7) films.
                    However, this doesn’t imply that short films are always better; in fact, there are also more very
                    low-rated short films compared to longer ones.

                    <h3>Implications:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Runtime alone is not a strong predictor of success. Instead, other factors such as
                            storytelling, production quality, and genre are likely more influential in determining
                            IMDb
                            ratings.</li>
                        <li>Investment in short-form content may yield higher highs, but it does not guarantee
                            better
                            ratings overall. While some of the highest-rated films are short, this category also
                            sees
                            more extreme reviews, both positive and negative. If we invest in short content, it
                            should
                            be carefully crafted to maximize impact and avoid pitfalls that lead to low ratings.
                        </li>
                        <li>A diverse content strategy remains valuable, as high and low ratings exist across all
                            runtime categories. Offering a mix of short, medium, and long content is a smart
                            approach.
                            This way, we can capture different audience preferences while reducing risk.</li>

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    Netflix’s content strategy has evolved in response to changing industry dynamics. Initially, the
                    platform focused on acquiring high-rated content to build credibility, then shifted toward mass
                    content expansion to attract a broader audience. Over time, Netflix refined its approach by
                    balancing quality with quantity. A key moment in this evolution occurred between 2013 and 2014, when
                    the rebound in IMDb scores highlighted the impact of Netflix’s investment in original programming.
                    High-quality, exclusive content like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black became central to
                    Netflix’s identity, helping it stand out in an increasingly competitive market. However, Netflix's
                    fluctuating IMDb scores also reflect the tension between content volume and quality. While rapid
                    expansion led to a temporary decline in ratings, the company ultimately stabilized its approach by
                    curating a diverse library that maintains a consistent level of quality while catering to a global
                    audience. These shifts in strategy are closely aligned with changes in the streaming landscape. As
                    competitors emerged, Netflix responded by scaling its content library, then refocusing on originals,
                    and finally balancing both strategies to sustain its market dominance.

                <ul>
                    <li>Netflix’s success hinges on its ability to adapt to audience preferences and industry shifts.
                        Streaming platforms must stay agile, analyzing viewer behavior to refine their offerings.</li>
                    <li>The rise of original programming highlights the need for exclusive, high-quality content to stay
                        competitive. Platforms that neglect strong originals risk losing engagement and brand loyalty.
                    </li>
                    <li>Balancing content volume and quality is crucial—too much variety can dilute brand identity,
                        while a narrow selection may limit reach. A well-curated, diverse catalog appeals to different
                        audience segments.</li>
                    <li>Trends in IMDb scores suggest Netflix fine-tunes its strategy using audience insights. Other
                        platforms can follow suit by leveraging data analytics to optimize content acquisition and
                        production.</li>
                    <li>As streaming evolves, success will depend on anticipating consumer expectations, maintaining

                            the amount of votes on that level of content is greater.
                            This is the case until the maturity level R.
                            NC-17 has significantly less votes than the rest of
                            the age ratings due to the age certifications
                            being far less popular than the rest listed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Average score is fairly consistent across the
                            various age certifications, despite the frequency of votes
                            all being greatly different.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Content rated TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and G tend to have
                            fewer total votes and slightly lower average scores.
                            This potentially means less IMDb user engagement with
                            content aimed at very young viewers — perhaps due to
                            IMDb’s adult-skewing user base.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            NC-17 ratings have a small presence in Netflix content.
                            This category appears with low scores and vote counts, indicating
                            it may represent niche or less mainstream content with
                            little access or appeal.

                        <li>
                            Streaming platforms and production companies should consider the larger engagement seen with
                            PG-13, R, and TV-MA rated content when planning releases or marketing strategies.
                            These categories clearly resonate more with IMDb’s user base, suggesting adult-oriented
                            content garners more interaction and discussion.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The lower vote counts for youth-rated content reflect IMDb’s likely adult-leaning user
                            demographic.
                            Platforms targeting families or younger audiences may find that IMDb ratings don't fully
                            capture
                            engagement from their core viewers and should rely on alternative metrics.

                        <li>
                            The sharp drop-off in votes for NC-17 content suggests a limited audience and potentially
                            reduced discoverability.
                            This could impact content placement decisions for media that falls into that rating,
                            especially on mainstream platforms
                            like Netflix.

                        <li>
                            Since age ratings correlate with vote volume, developers and researchers should be cautious
                            using IMDb data as a proxy
                            for popularity or quality across all age groups. The data may overrepresent certain segments
                            (like adult viewers)
                            and underrepresent others (like children or families).

                            While average score may be very similar, the popularity difference across maturity levels
                            indicates that we should look further into the individual distributions for each age rating.

        <h2>IMDb Score Distribution by Age Rating</h2>
        <p>Next, to get a better picture in case of skewed distributions for each age rating,
            we will use a side-by-side boxplot showing the distributions for the levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The figure shows side-by-side boxplots for Netflix movies and shows.
            Each boxplot represents one of the age categories/rating.
            For each of these age ratings, the boxplot shows the distribution of the
            IMDb scores for content in that certain age group.
            Use the drop-down below the chart to select age ratings for TV or Movie.
            Hover over the boxes to see the metrics.

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <h4>TV</h4>
                    <p>
                        The distributions for the boxplots largely overlap with one another.
                        This may indicate that Netflix is generally consistent with the quality of
                        content across various age certifications.
                        Several of the ratings have outliers, but for the ratings 'TV-MA' and 'TV-14',
                        there appear to be many outliers. Additionally, they seem to have whiskers
                        that extend across a spread out range of values compared to other ratings.
                        The 'G' rating appears to have the smallest spread, and is not majorly skewed in either
                        direction.
                    </p>
                    <h4>MOVIE</h4>
                    <p>
                        The boxplots also overlap for the movies, showing pretty similar distributions.
                        However, content levels PG-13 and R appear to have a larger spread relative to
                        lower maturity levels. NC-17 has only one value, indicating that in this dataset,
                        there is probably just one NC-17 film.
                        PG has outliers on both the left and right side of the dsitribution.
                        PG-13 and R have numerous lower outliers.

                    <p>
                        We can see that the majority of age ratings with outliers appear to be skewed to the left.
                        The averages across all levels were similar, but the distributions indicate that for the more
                        popular categories--the ones that cater to more mature audiences--are possibly more well
                        received
                        thought when we saw the initial findings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, they have many, many lower outliers, yet their average scores
                        still remain the second and third largest out of all the ratings
                        (by less than a tenth). Without outliers, the projected average ratings would be larger--and
                        probably by a significant amount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is known that Netflix has strategically utilized more "bingeable" content--often TV shows
                        that are TV-14 and TV-MA. Based on the popularity and positive reception of this content,
                        Netflix
                        should continue to release more content that users are able to "binge-watch" to keep up with
                        competitors.

                    <p>
                        The scatterplot reveals a potential relationship between the IMDb rating and the number of
                        reviews (votes) a movie or TV show has received. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through this visualization we can see that movies and TV shows with higher ratings often tend to have a
                        larger number of reviews, especially if they are well-known or widely appreciated by the audience.
                        This indicates that the most popular and highly rated content tends to accumulate more reviews
                        over time.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, there may be some content with high IMDb ratings but fewer
                        reviews, possibly indicating niche content, older movies, or shows that were well-received by a smaller
                        audience.

                <p>
                    A higher number of reviews might correlate with greater audience
                    engagement. Content that generates more reviews could indicate that it is widely discussed,
                    analyzed, or critiqued, suggesting it is popular or has a passionate fanbase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studios and content creators could use this data to assess the level of engagement with their
                    content. For example, if a film or series has a high rating but low votes, it may indicate that
                    while the content is well-received, it has not reached a large audience or lacks the viral quality
                    that drives more people to review it.

                        The scatter plot reveals how the average IMDb ratings of movies and TV shows have fluctuated
                        over the years.
                        A noticeable trend (either upward or downward) could indicate shifts in audience preferences or
                        changes in
                        production quality.<br>

                    <p>
                        Within the above data visualization, the size of the circles represents the number of releases each year.
                        If certain years have significantly larger circles, it suggests peak periods in content
                        production, possibly influenced by factors like streaming platform expansions or major industry shifts.

                    <p>
                     The outliers that can be seen within the dataset (e.g., a year with an unusually high or low average rating) may signal
                        significant
                        events such as the rise of a particular genre, the influence of a major franchise, or changes in

                    Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Max could use this data to assess past trends and determine
                    optimal
                    content release strategies.
                    If TV shows have consistently higher ratings than movies in certain periods, they might prioritize

                    production.

                    advancements) can be analyzed in correlation with the data, providing insights into how external
                    factors influence entertainment consumption. This can then inform large streaming platforms on how the number of releases

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The analysis of IMDb ratings across various factors, including media length, Netflix's content strategy,
            maturity levels, and audience engagement, has revealed several valuable insights.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="key-findings">
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Media Length and Ratings: Runtime alone is not a strong predictor of audience reception. Short films
                have a broader range of ratings, making them riskier investments, while longer films generally receive
                more consistent scores.</li>
            <li>Netflix’s Content Strategy: Netflix has shifted from acquiring highly rated content to balancing
                quantity and quality, with original programming becoming a key driver of success.</li>
            <li>Maturity Ratings and Audience Engagement: PG-13, R, and TV-MA content receive the most IMDb votes, while
                youth-oriented and NC-17 content tend to see lower engagement, possibly due to IMDb’s adult-skewed user
                base.</li>
            <li>Ratings and Review Volume: Highly rated content often garners more reviews, whereas some niche content
                may receive high ratings but have limited audience reach.</li>
            <li>Trends Over Time: IMDb rating fluctuations reflect industry shifts, streaming expansion, and changing
                audience preferences. The number of releases per year aligns with platform growth and major
                entertainment trends.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="limitations">
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>IMDb’s user base may not fully represent all audiences, especially for family-friendly or niche content.
            </li>
            <li>Regional differences are not accounted for, which could influence rating trends based on cultural
                preferences.</li>
            <li>Correlation does not imply causation—high ratings do not necessarily lead to high engagement and vice
                versa.</li>
            <li>Additional quality metrics, such as audience retention and social media engagement, are not considered.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="future-recommendations">
        <h3>Future Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Streaming platforms should balance quality and quantity by leveraging data-driven insights.</li>
            <li>High-rated but low-review content presents an opportunity for targeted marketing to increase awareness
                and engagement.</li>
            <li>Future analyses could incorporate additional engagement metrics, such as watch time and review
                sentiment, for a more comprehensive understanding.</li>
            <li>Segmenting ratings by geographic region could help tailor content strategies for diverse audiences.</li>
            <li>Continuous monitoring of industry trends and audience behaviors is crucial for adapting to technological
                advancements in the entertainment landscape.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By leveraging these insights, content creators and streaming platforms can optimize their strategies to
            sustain long-term success and maximize audience engagement.</p>
